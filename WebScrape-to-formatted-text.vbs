'-- Web-To-Text will convert a webpage to text. Drop an HTML file on the script or double-click
 '-- and enter the full path.
'--  If the file was named, For example, index.html a file will appear in the
'-- same folder called index.txt. The URL text of links can be included or Not.

'--**the script starts by asking whether you want to save URL text. That means that any links
'--    in the page will also include the URL, written as :  url - link text. ex.: http:\\www.yahoo.com - Go To Yahoo

'--**Next the script gets the file and reads it into a textstream, dropping blank lines.

'--** Then the string is sent to StripIt Function to replace relevant tags, such as <BR>,
'-- and clean out all non-relevant tags. 
'--stripit goes through from one tag to the Next, getting the text between them.
'--    If it finds a link tag (HREF=) it can also Get the URL from that and insert it ahead of the link text seen on the webpage.

'-- **The string without tags is sent back and all ASCII codes are translated. 

'--** finally, the string is written to a new file with .TXT extension.

'-- The results from this script will vary depending on how the HTML page was
'--written. Ideally all vbCrLf should be removed before processing but that would
'--also require that all header tags, <PRE> tags, etc. be processed. This script
'--uses a simpler method that work fairly well in most cases.
